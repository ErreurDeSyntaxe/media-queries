### Objective

The goal of the project is to learn media queries and RWD by building a simple
webpage that will resize smoothly across different-sized screens. The aim is
to have five different groups of sizes (extra small, small, medium, large, and
extra large). The general cut-off points are 600px, 768px, 992px, and 1200px.

Initially, the project will have two sizes (mobile and computer), and depending
on the process and external pressures, it might reach the five-size objective
stated above.

###### Project Statement

There is no project statement.

### Features

- The web page will resize and look nice on five different sizes. The layout
  will be clean and easy to read.

## Diary

I struggle with resizing my web pages. They end up looking pretty bad on mobile
because I design them for computers first and then fail to find the right CSS
to fit both sizes.
